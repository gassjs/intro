## Independent Practice (25 min)

When programming user interfaces, you will often need to display results based on a certain input. In this exercise, you'll design a program that will let users know what legal privileges they can enjoy based on their age.

Write a program that outputs results based on usersâ€™ age. This exercise draws on if/else statements, Boolean logic, and comparison operators. See the conditions below:

- If you are under 16, you cannot do much outside of going to school
- If you are 16 or older, you can drive
- If you 18 or older, you can vote AND drink.
- If you are 25 or older, you can rent a car
- If you are 35 or older, you can run for prime minister
- If you are 62 or older, you collect your pension.

Have the program print out only the most recent thing that they've become eligible to do, i.e. if they are 46, only print "You can run for prime minister".
