# JavaScript Development
## Introduction

- **Model** means it can be applied in different contexts
- **DNS server** lookup dns records
    - Retail store analogy

### Web Production
- Take designs and turn them into code + assets with html/css
- Use JS for interactions
- **Node** lets you run JS outside of browser
- **compiled** cf **just-in-time**

- **Terminal** a text input/output environment to interact with a computer
- **Console** traditionally a physical terminal but used interchangeably with...
- `echo` returns a string

##### Git
- `diff`
    - Tests changes to a *file*
    - Run *before* adding files
- `pull request` requests a `merge`
- `origin` is the **one-true-fork**
- `pus` whereto `->` which branch

`undefined` is not an error; it indicates there's no further processes arising from a variable assignment ie *returns* nothing

##### Node
- `_` character is reserved result of last operation
- tab complete variables
- words: `.break` `.clear` `.clear` same as `<C-c>`
- `.help` with words

You `.save+filename` saves session which can be referenced by `.load+filename`

<dl>
<dt>.help</dt>
<dd>.break</dt>    Sometimes you get stuck, this gets you out
<dd>..clear</dt>    Alias for .break
<dd>..editor</dt>   Enter editor mode
<dd>. .exit</dt>     Exit the repl
<dd>..help  </dt>   Print this help message
<dd>..load</dt>     Load JS from a file into the REPL session
<dd>..save</dt>     Save all evaluated commands in this REPL session to a file
